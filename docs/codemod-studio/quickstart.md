### **User Authentication with Clerk**

We use Clerk, a secure authentication service, to handle user registration and login. Clerk provides us with essential user authentication features, such as secure password management and multi-factor authentication. When you create an account or log in using our web app, Clerk processes and stores your authentication data.

### **Processing User Requests with OpenAI**

Our web app leverages OpenAI's capabilities to process user requests and provide relevant responses. When you interact with AI Assistant or VSCode Export in Codemod Studio, some information (such as code snippets, prompts, etc.) will be sent to OpenAI's servers for processing. We do not store the text inputs you provide for processing beyond what is necessary for delivering the service.
