:::note
In this example, we’re using the [`vercel/next.js`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) repository and [`replace-next-router`](https://github.com/intuita-inc/codemod-registry/tree/main/codemods/ts-morph/next/13/replace-next-router) upgrade codemod.

Intuita is in Public Beta and we’re continuously working on improving codemods and solving any compatibility issues.
If you run into an issue while running a codemod, please [let us know →](https://feedback.intuita.io/feature-requests-and-bugs)
