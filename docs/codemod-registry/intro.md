## Codemod Registry

Intuita’s Codemod Registry is an organized and maintained collection of codemods that can be used to help you upgrade several frameworks and libraries for your projects.

To get started with running codemods, you have to browse the list of publicly available codemods in the codemod registry. To do so, you need to click on the Intuita extension sidebar menu and look for **Public Codemods.**
