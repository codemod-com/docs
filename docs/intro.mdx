## How It Works ðŸª„

Imagine your codebase has been relying on an older version of NextJS for a long time. Although you had intended to upgrade to version 13 a few times, the extensive manual work required prevented you from doing so, causing you to miss out on the performance benefits and potential security fixes. But now the time has come where postponing the upgrade is no longer an option, and the drudgery of the upgrade must be done immediately to maintain the integrity & performance of your codebase.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("img/intro/dependency-needs-refactor-light.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("img/intro/dependency-needs-refactor-dark.png")
  }}
/>

But worry not. Intuita, powered by the best code transformation engines (such as Facebook's JScodeshift, Uber's Piranha, & soon ML-powered egines), runs a set of well-governed codemods on your codebase to automate the bulk of this upgrade for you. ðŸª„
