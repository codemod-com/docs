Intuita is a codemod manager ðŸ¤– that makes migrations, dependency upgrades & large refactorings faster & easier for codebases of any size. [Get started â†’](getting-started/getting-started-overview)



Intuita is open source & supports the best codemod engines out there, such as Facebook's JSCodeShift, Uber's Piranha, & soon ML-powered engines.

> We're constantly supporting new amazing codemods ([check our list of currently supported codemods](contributing/roadmap#currently-supported)).<br />
> If your favorite codemod engine is not supported yet, please [create an issue](https://github.com/intuita-inc/intuita-vscode-extension/issues/new) for us to prioritize.


:::note

## How It Works ðŸª„


Intuita's is a powerful codemod manager that supports many popular codemods.

How does it do it, you might ask.

Intuita works through a powerful engine that is able to run a codemod for your desired package, and scan your codebase for needed refactors to migrate to the new version of the package in a breeze.

Let's say for example your codebase depends on NextJS v12, and you want to upgrade to NextJS v13. However, there are some changes you'd need to do in all your codebase, causing so much wasted time, making you give up the benefits that would come with new versions and have potential critical security vulnerabilities in your codebase.

    light: useBaseUrl("img/intro/dependency-needs-refactor-light.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("img/intro/dependency-needs-refactor-dark.png")
  }}
/>

With that being said, Intuita is able to run needed codemods to let you solve this issue in seconds (literally). 

By running Intuita, Intuita will go over your codebase and do all the behind-the-scenes complex logic to migrate your codebase and make it operational with the new dependency version.

ðŸª„ Magic, right?
