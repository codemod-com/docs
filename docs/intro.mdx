<h1 align="center">Intuita</h1>
<h2 align="center">The new way to build, share & run codemods at any scale.</h2>


Intuita is a specialized platform for creating, distributing, and deploying code transformation bots (also known as codemods) in codebases of any size.

Intuita's AI-powered, community-led codemods and automation recipes enable you to automate framework upgrades, large refactoring, and boilerplate programming with unmatched speed and developer experience.

## The Platform

![Intuita Platform Architecture](/img/docs/intuita-platform-architecture.png)


### 1. Codemod Studio

Codemods have superpowers, but building them isn't easy. Codemod Studio lets you “instantly” create code transformation bots with AI, specialized helpers & debuggers, and a vibrant “codemod champion” community.

### 2. Codemod Registry

Codemod Registry is a collection of codemods and automation recipes built on top of popular engines like Meta’s jscodeshift, ts-morph, and less popular yet very powerful ones such as Uber's piranha. 

Contribute your codemods to the registry and make them easily accessible to your users worldwide.

Progressive framework builders are already onboard, keeping their users up-to-date with automatic upgrades and migrations.

### 3. CLI & IDE Extension

Use Intuita CLI or VS Code extension to effortlessly discover and run codemods, with a safe dry-run feature to preview changes before applying them. Easily customize or enhance existing codemods for yourself and the community with a quick feedback loop.

### 4. Scaled Deployment (Enterprise)

In large teams making thousands of changes isn't a walk in the park, but an even tougher challenge is getting those changes to land. At Intuita, we're building a dedicated platform to orchestrate large changes across many teams and empower campaign owners to see through their large migration projects. This piece of Intuita’s platform is only needed for enterprises with large codebases and teams. Contact us for more info.

Intuita is an [open source](https://github.com/intuita-inc) code evolution platform that makes migrations, dependency upgrades & large refactorings faster & easier for codebases of any size.


> We're actively adding new codemods for popular framework upgrades. [check our list of currently supported codemods](contributing/roadmap#currently-supported).<br />
> If your favorite framework upgrade is not supported yet, please [create an issue](https://github.com/intuita-inc/intuita-vscode-extension/issues/new) for us to prioritize.


:::note

Intuita is in Public Beta! [Get in touch](https://join.slack.com/t/intuita-inc/shared_invite/zt-1bjj5exxi-95yPfWi71HcO2p_sS5L2wA) if you are planning to use Intuita for large upgrades & you have some feature requests!

## How It Works 🪄

Imagine your codebase has been relying on an older version of NextJS for a long time. Although you had intended to upgrade to version 13 a few times, the extensive manual work required prevented you from doing so, causing you to miss out on the performance benefits and potential security fixes. But now the time has come where postponing the upgrade is no longer an option, and the drudgery of the upgrade must be done immediately to maintain the integrity & performance of your codebase.

<ThemedImage

    dark: useBaseUrl("img/intro/dependency-needs-refactor-dark.png")
  }}
/>

But worry not. Intuita, powered by the best code transformation engines (such as Facebook's JScodeshift, Uber's Piranha, & soon ML-powered egines), runs a set of well-governed codemods on your codebase to automate the bulk of this upgrade for you. 🪄
